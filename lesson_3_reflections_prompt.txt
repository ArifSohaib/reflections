When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When collaborating on a project or when working on a project from multiple locations/computers it would be much better to use a remote repository.
  Another reason is to use the remote as a backup of the repository in case of emergency.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
